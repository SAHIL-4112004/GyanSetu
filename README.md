📌 Note
We are currently in second-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering students. 
Due to our limited experience in building AI-based platforms and the short project timeline, 
we were not able to develop a fully working model of the application.
However, to convey our vision clearly, we have included **design mockups/images** that 
represent how the final application would look and function. We hope our effort effectively 
communicates the concept and potential of Gyansetu.
